\section{Binary Search}
    \subsection*{Question}
        Using the following prototype to create recursive and iterative binary search functions:\\
        \mintinline{cpp}{bool binarySearch(int *list, int size, int value)}

    \subsection*{Reflection}
        I prefer the recursive solution, both in terms of readability and design intent.
        The recursive solution works especially well with arrays as a pointer to any position
        within the array can be considered as its own array. 
        This makes it easy to create and pass along sub-arrays during recursion.
