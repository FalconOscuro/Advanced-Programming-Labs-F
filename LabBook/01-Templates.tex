    \subsection*{Question}
        Turn the Grid class from lab D into a template class, 
        allowing it to store any type of number, e.g. float, int, double, into the 2D grid array.

    \subsection*{Reflection}
        All definitions for grid functions were moved to the header file allowing for full
        functionality of the template class. 
        This is often reffered to as an \textit{hpp} file, 
        containing both the class defintion, as with a normal header file,
        alongside the class function source code.
